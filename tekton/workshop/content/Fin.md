If you would like to reference the content from this workshop in the future, please feel free to browse the [source](https://github.com/RedHatGov/openshift-devsecops) that built it, or the [lab guide source](https://github.com/RedHatGov/openshift-devsecops-labguides). The workshop was built with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), which is easy to read, understand, and reuse. The lab guides are defined in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), which is also pretty easy to read.
