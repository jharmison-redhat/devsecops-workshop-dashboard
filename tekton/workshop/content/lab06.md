In this lab we will take our first steps in starting our DevSecOps pipeline. In doing so, we will not only end up with a working pipeline that performs a basic action on our project, but we will also discover a few ways to experiment with, work with, and learn about Tekton

# First Steps - Create a Resource for the Project

The project that we're working with is stored in a Git repository. The way Tekton uses Git repositories is by using a Git pipeline resource pointing to our source code repository.

Before we start working with Tekton, let's switch the default project to the `%username%-cicd` project:

```execute
oc project %username%-cicd
```

Let's figure out how to create a new Git pipeline resource:

```execute
tkn --help
```

The `tkn` cli tells us what resources we can interact with. We know that we want to create a Pipeline Resource, so let's see how it can help us with that.

```execute
tkn resource --help
```

Before we create the new Pipeline Resource, let's get the URL of the gitea server instance - note the URL of the server, which we will use in a bit to create a PipelineResource with:

```execute
oc get route -n devsecops gitea-server
```

So, the command we need is `create`. Then, let's create a new resource:

```execute
tkn resource create
```

Enter information like the following:

```text
? Enter a name for a pipeline resource : tasks-source-code
? Select a resource type to create :  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
  cloudEvent
  cluster
> git
  image
  pullRequest
  storage
? Select a resource type to create : git
? Enter a value for url :  https://gitea-server-devsecops.%cluster_subdomain%/%username%/openshift-tasks.git
? Enter a value for revision :  dso4
```

So, now we have created a resource manually using the `tkn` CLI. We could have similarly created the Pipeline Resource using YAML, and provided it to the `oc` cli as native Kubernetes YAML. The YAML snippet below could be used to create the same PipelineResource :

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: PipelineResource
metadata:
  name: tasks-source-code
spec:
  params:
    - name: url
      value: >-
        https://gitea-server-devsecops.%cluster_subdomain%/%username%/openshift-tasks.git
    - name: revision
      value: dso4
  type: git
```

The additional options for specifying the Git Pipeline Resource are on the [Tekton github page](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/resources.md#git-resource)

## Explore Tasks Catalog

The Tasks application is built using Maven, so we will need to find a container that has maven inside so that we can use it to build our application.

The first place we can look is the Cluster Task catalog that exists in OpenShift.

![Maven Cluster Task](images/maven_clustertask.png)

Let's see what this ClusterTask is all about.

```execute
tkn clustertask describe maven
```

The output of the task description looks similar to the one below:

```text
Name:   maven

ðŸ“¨ Input Resources

 No input resources

ðŸ“¡ Output Resources

 No output resources

âš“ Params

 NAME                      TYPE     DESCRIPTION              DEFAULT VALUE

 âˆ™ PROXY_PROTOCOL          string   Protocol for the pr...   http

ðŸ¦¶ Steps

 âˆ™ mvn-settings
 âˆ™ mvn-goals
```

Based on the output from the command above, we could run the cluster task with the following TaskRun. Unfortunately, at this time, creating a Task Run from the UI is not supported, so we'll build our own YAML (while inspecting the details of the [Task Runs docs in Tekton](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/taskruns.md)). Create the TaskRun using the YAML below in your `%username%-cicd` project:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  generateName: maven-example-
spec:
  taskRef:
    kind: ClusterTask
    name: maven
```

However, doing that fails - what's happening here ? Let's inspect the TaskRun that we just created (run the command and choose the latest `maven-example-` TaskRun)

```execute
tkn tr logs -f
```

The results look similar to the output below

```text
task maven has failed: bound workspaces did not match declared workspaces: didn't provide required values: [source maven-settings]
Error: pod for taskrun maven-example-k9bhw not available yet
```

Well, well - the error message complains about workspaces not being provided. If we re-looked at the ClusterTask we would see that it specifies two workspaces that need to be provided to use this cluster task:

* source
* maven-settings

Let's give it some empty workspaces and see if we can make it run. Create the TaskRun from the YAML below:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  generateName: maven-example-
spec:
  taskRef:
    kind: ClusterTask
    name: maven
  params:
    - name: GOALS
      value:
      - clean
      - package
  workspaces:
    - name: maven-settings
      emptyDir: {}
    - name: source
      emptyDir: {}
```

If we create this TaskRun and show the logs from running it, we will see an error message that there is no POM file in /workspace/source. Duh! Of course - we gave this task an empty directory as the "source" workspace, of course it will not be able to build our source - there is nothing there !!!

Run the command below and choose the latest `maven-example-` TaskRun:

```execute
tkn tr logs -f
```

The output looks similar to the listing below:

```text
... snipped for brevity ...
[mvn-goals] [INFO] Scanning for projects...
[mvn-goals] [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[mvn-goals] [INFO] BUILD FAILURE

... snipped for brevity ...
container step-mvn-goals has failed  : [{"key":"StartedAt","value":"2020-07-20T22:08:06Z","resourceRef":{}}]
```

So, while the ClusterTask seemed like a decent first pass at how to build our app, it appears this might require a bit more knowledge to use this ClusterTask (e.g. we will need to have a prior task that puts the Git repo into the `source` workspace). Let's put this on ice for a bit and explore some more.

## Local Containers: Experimentation and Feedback loops

---
> **NOTE**
> The entire section below is entirely optional and depends on having some tools installed locally on a local workstation that can clone source control repo (e.g. git) and run containers locally (e.g. podman). As a result, the instructions below cannot be executed in the `Terminal` of this lab. If you have `git` and `podman` installed on your local workstation (which I hope you do - here are the [Podman installation instructions](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation.html)), you can proceed with the steps below; if not, simply review the steps below and then proceed at the [Create Standalone TaskRun](#create-standalone-taskrun) section of the lab.
>
> While you can pretty reasonably use OpenShift as a way to execute a standalone container (including some of the Tekton containers we play with in this section), e.g.: `oc run  --image=gcr.io/cloud-builders/mvn -i -t mvn-builder --rm --restart=Never --command -- /bin/bash`
> However, the examples below really lean into providing some "local resources" (e.g. such as a git repository clone) to the container, which would be more complicated in OpenShift (e.g. setting up a Persistent Volume with the checkout, providing that PV to the container, etc.) which would cancel the power and simplicity of the "local development" examples below.
---

OK, now we're back to the drawing board - we couldn't use the ClusterTask out of the box with our existing knowledge, but let's see what we can learn from it.

First off, let's talk about the importance of feedback loops. As engineers, we always want to have a short and tight feedback loop. The tighter the feedback loop, the faster we could experiment, and then the faster we could learn. From experience, the tightest feedback loop happens when engineers can play with things locally on their workstations. How could we do that with Tekton ? Luckily, since Tekton is based entirely on running containers, we have a way !

Re-reviewing the content of the `maven` ClusterTask, we can see exactly what container image the ClusterTask uses : `gcr.io/cloud-builders/mvn` . If we're curious, we pull down that image and explore it by using it just like any other container. We will check what version of Maven is in there using `mvn -version`, and then we will `exit`:

* The `-it` argument to `podman` gives us an "interactive tty/shell", whereas the `--entrypoint` argument allows us to override what will be executed when the container starts (the equivalent podman command is ``)

```bash
podman run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash gcr.io/cloud-builders/mvn
```

Now that we're inside the container, let's see what Java and Maven versions are in there :

```text
$ mvn -version

Apache Maven 3.6.3 (cecedd343002696d0abb50b32b541b8a6ba2883f)
Maven home: /usr/share/maven
Java version: 14.0.1, vendor: Oracle Corporation, runtime: /usr/java/openjdk-14
Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "linux", version: "5.6.19-300.fc32.x86_64", arch: "amd64", family: "unix"
```

Let's exit the container and continue exploring. Please make a note to remember to `exit` from the container when we're done working with it in the subsequent commands below.

OK, this container uses Java 14, and our tasks app uses Java 8. This might be a problem, but we can table this issue for now and see how things go. Let's clone our `tasks` git repo and see if we can build it with this Maven container.

```bash
git clone -b dso4 https://gitea-server-devsecops.%cluster_subdomain%/%username%/openshift-tasks.git openshift-tasks-dso4
```

Now we've cloned the git repo into the local workstation into the openshift-tasks-dso4 directory. Now we can try to re-run the Maven container and mount that directory:

* We're mounting it into the /workspace/source directory because that's where normally Tekton would mount a PipelineResource named `source` . When we're experimenting with this image to build the sources, we want to make it as similar as we can to how Tekton will run it, so that it's super easy to make it work in Tekton afterwards
* We're also adding the :Z option on the mount to appease SELinux

```shell
podman run -v $(pwd)/openshift-tasks-dso4:/workspace/source:Z -it --entrypoint /bin/bash gcr.io/cloud-builders/mvn
ls /workspace/source/
```

We should see the top-level content of the source control repository that we cloned and we mounted in the container:

> app-template.yaml  configuration  pipeline-bc.yaml  pom.xml  README.md

And we can try to do a clean package from the POM:

```shell
mvn clean package -f /workspace/source/pom.xml
```

Woo-hoo!!! We verified that the app source code is in the /workspace/source directory, and we can run the build. The build runs for a while and.... Womp, womp ! It fails with a Java compile error !!!

```text
[ERROR] /workspace/source/src/main/java/org/jboss/as/quickstarts/tasksrs/model/Task.java:[137,16] cannot find symbol

```

It looks like we can't use Java 14 to  build my app after all ! Let's  go and see what else might be in that `gcr.io/cloud-builders/mvn`

![Maven Container Images](images/grc_io_maven_images.png)

Well, well - it looks like there is a Java 8 image there after all. Let's give that another try with a local container, we just have to use the `3.5.0-jdk-8` label and see that we can build our project.

Start the container again, this time with the container with the needed Maven version:

```bash
podman run -v $(pwd)/openshift-tasks-dso4:/workspace/source:Z -it --entrypoint /bin/bash gcr.io/cloud-builders/mvn:3.5.0-jdk-8
```

Let's run the build again and see what happens

```bash
mvn clean package -f /workspace/source/pom.xml
```

The output from the command should be similar to the content below:

```text
[INFO] Scanning for projects...

[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------

```

W00t, w00t !! The build runs for a little while and successfully completes - now we are getting somewhere !!!

The big takeaways from the work so far:

* Since Tekton runs all of the tasks in pods, we can very easily experiment with the same containers locally until we see something work
* With a little bit of knowledge about how Tekton works, we can mount the directories in our local containers to make it as similar as possible for when we move our work into Tekton proper

---
> **NOTE**
> After either walking through the above locally, or at least reading through it a bit, you should be ready to continue with Tekton and OpenShift!
---

## Create Standalone TaskRun

Now that we know how to use the Maven container (with the right Java version) to build our project, we can go back and have Tekton run it for us. As a first step, we will create a new TaskRun which uses an `inline` Task spec - just so that we don't have to create a separate Task object while we're still experimenting

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  generateName: maven-java8-inline-example-
spec:
  resources:
    inputs:
      - name: source
        resourceRef:
          name: tasks-source-code
  taskSpec:
    resources:
      inputs:
        - name: source
          type: git
    steps:
    - name: mvn-goals
      args:
        - clean
        - package
        - -f
        - $(inputs.resources.source.path)/pom.xml
      command:
        - /usr/bin/mvn
      image: gcr.io/cloud-builders/mvn:3.5.0-jdk-8
```

A couple of things to note in the TaskRun example above:

* Since the `spec.taskSpec.resources.inputs` specifies that the Task requires a Git input resource, the TaskRun has to provide it in the `spec.resources.inputs` field.
* In the example above we used Tekton's parameter substitution - e.g. a PipelineResource named `foo` will be mounted in /workspace/foo, and can be referenced using the `$(inputs.resources.foo.path)` parameter substitution. Note that we're also using the `.path` suffix after the name of the resource to get its absolute path (a little bit more Tekton resource magic from the [Tekton Git repo](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/resources.md#variable-substitution)

With this, we can observe Tekton successfully run our Maven commands (choose the `maven-java8-inline-example-` TaskRun):

```execute
tkn tr logs -f
```

The output of the command is similar to the output below:

```text
... snipped for brevity ...
[mvn-goals] [INFO] Packaging webapp
[mvn-goals] [INFO] Assembling webapp [jboss-tasks-rs] in [/workspace/source/target/openshift-tasks]

[mvn-goals] [INFO] Webapp assembled in [51 msecs]

[mvn-goals] [INFO] Final Memory: 32M/969M
[mvn-goals] [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

So now, the last step is to take our TaskSpec and move it into a standalone task. We'll convert from `arg/command` format to `script` format here to ensure that code coverage reports are generated correctly later:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: simple-maven
spec:
  resources:
      inputs:
        - name: source
          type: git
  steps:
    - name: mvn-goals
      script: |
        /usr/bin/mvn clean package -f $(inputs.resources.source.path)/pom.xml
      image: gcr.io/cloud-builders/mvn:3.5.0-jdk-8
```

Now that we have a task, we can really simplify the TaskRun:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  generateName: simple-maven-
spec:
  resources:
    inputs:
      - name: source
        resourceRef:
          name: tasks-source-code
  taskRef:
    name: simple-maven
```

We can also see the TaskRun succeed - run the command below and choose the latest `simple-maven` task run:

```execute
tkn tr logs -f
```

The output from the Task Run is similar to the content below:

```text
#... snipped for brevity ...

```

## Add the Task into a one-step pipeline

Now that we can execute the task from the TaskRun, we can proceed and create our first pipeline. This pipeline will:

* Declare a single Git pipeline resource that needs to be provided to it
* It will use this resource to invoke the simple-maven task

If we want to use the Web Console:

![Simple Maven Pipeline](images/simple-maven-pipeline.png)

Or using yaml (if you want to be fancy and use `vim` and `oc apply -f`):

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: tasks-dev-pipeline
spec:
  resources:
    - name: tasks-source-code
      type: git
  tasks:
    - name: simple-maven
      resources:
        inputs:
          - name: source
            resource: tasks-source-code
      taskRef:
        kind: Task
        name: simple-maven
```

Now, starting this pipeline is pretty straightforward, even using the GUI - the Console will launch a prompt to specify which PipelineResource needed to invoke the pipeline with:

![Start Pipeline GUI](images/start-simple-pipeline.png)

We can now observe the execution of the Pipeline Run in the Console and follow the logs:
![Pipeline Logs](images/simple-pipelinerun-logs.png)

## Conclusion

In this lab we learned how to explore what Tekton provides, and we have some easy building blocks that we can use going forward, regardless of what steps we need to build the pipeline with. In summary, the steps are as follows:

1. Find a container that has the tool that we need - be it maven, s2i, or just plain bash.
1. Launch the container with the tool locally to figure out the details on how to interact with the tool. Here, we might need to play with some podman/docker options with mounting directories, etc. The more you can replicate some of the conventions of the Tekton environment (e.g. where resources are mounted, where workspaces end up, etc), the easier it will be to later transition to Tekton.
1. Once we have the arguments that we need to invoke the container with, we can now experiment with a TaskRun with an inline Task - this way we can see Tekton execute the tool and we can adjust the tool parameters and perform the relevant parameter substitutions, paths, etc.
1. Once we have a working Task, move it to a standalone Task. Confirm that the standalone Task works with a TaskRun (with all the right parameters)
1. Once we have a working standalone Task, integrate it into a Pipeline
1. Run the Pipeline

The next lab will explore further how to make a Task a reusable component.
